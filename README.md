## User manual

It is better to not try to clone and run, this stuff is mostly for developers.
Please use installers when they will be available.

## Development installation

1. Clone repository
2. Create virtual environment with python 3.11+, may be earlier versions will work too, but i do not support them.
3. Install `requirements-dev.txt`
4. Execute `cli.py` to run application

Happy hacking.

If you want to commit to repository please install pre-commit in cloned repository via `pre-commit install`,
then your changes will be properly formatted at commit.

And do not forget to run mypy, it sometimes produces useful errors and warnings.

Linters and tests will run from GitHub side after you push to repository.
